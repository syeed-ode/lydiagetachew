# Lydia Getachew Homework Help

Hey Lydia, all the code you need is here. If you we are able to chat one on one I can help you through some of the design concerns I have. For eample a lot of the methods you have in your "static void main(String [] args)" method should be in a sepate class.

This would make your code easier to read.

You can view all of the code here in the Git website. Or, you you can download git on your computer and pull all of the packages themselves and compile everything out of the box. 

I can walk you through how to download and use Git. Send me an email with the best time and medium to chat: Gmail, Facebook, Telegram, Houseparty, or something else.
